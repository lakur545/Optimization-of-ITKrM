# Optimization of ITKrM
This github page entails the sequential and parallel optimization of the dictionary learning algorithm ITKrM, as defined by Karin Schnass.

Her document is called Convergence radius and sample complexity of ITKrM algorithms for dictionary learning. 

It was featured in Applied and Computational Harmonic Analysis, 2016. ISSN 1063-5203. doi: 10.1016/j.acha.2016.08.002.

The files within code are all the code files made through out the project, rather messy at the moment.

The files within project_code are all the code files used for testing throughout the project, cleaner, though very specific code.
